# README #

This project template includes didactic artifacts aimed to support the project development during the 3rd semester of the Software Engineering (ESOFT) course unit of the [Degree in Telecommunications and Informatics Engineering (LETI)](https://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/473) at the [School of Engineering – Polytechnic of Porto (ISEP)](https://www.isep.ipp.pt).

Specifically, it provides:

- The [Team Members and Task Distribution](docs/TeamMembersAndTasks.md) across sprints;
- [Template files](docs/(template-files)) to capture and systematize evidence of proper application of the Software Development Process, namely regarding the activities of Engineering Requirements, OO Analysis and Design.

This project template serves as an umbrella for its subprojects — Core, CoreTests, and ConsoleApp — and follows the same structure as the **DemoTasks** project used in the lab classes. Accordingly:

- **Core** should be a _library_ containing the domain entities and business logic;
- **CoreTests** should include a suite of regression tests targeting the Core components;
- **ConsoleApp** should be console-based executable application that provides a basic User Interface (UI), allowing users to interact with core application functionalities.
