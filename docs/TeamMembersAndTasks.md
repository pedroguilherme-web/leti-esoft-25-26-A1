# 2. Task Distribution ###

Throughout the project development period, the distribution of tasks, requirements, and features among team members was organized as shown in the table below.

Please note that in every sprint there are:

- Tasks that **must be** performed collaboratively by all team members. These are considered team responsibilities, and each member is expected to actively contribute to their successful completion;
- Tasks related to Software Development Process (SDP) activities within the scope of a single User Story (US), which are primarily assigned to individual team members. In other words, each US-related task is the responsibility of a specific team member.

While responsibilities may be distributed among team members, **effective collaboration and mutual support are essential**. Additionally, all members should maintain a comprehensive understanding of the entire project, beyond their assigned tasks.

Finally, keep in mind that each User Story is not isolated — it must be integrated with the others. Once again, **integration is a shared team responsibility**.

**The following table must always be kept up to date.**
