# US14 - Register an employee

## 1. Requirements Engineering

Receptionists and nurses registered in the application will take part in the vaccination process. Both
roles are defined by attributes such as automatically generated ID, name, postal address, phone
number, and email. Given that staff allocation to vaccination centers may not be straightforward, by
now the system might assume that receptionists and nurses can work at any vaccination center.

### 1.1. User Story Description

As Administrator, I want to register an employee.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

_Insert here any related specification and/or clarification provided by the client together with **your interpretation**. When possible, provide a link to such specifications/clarifications._

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- AC14-1: Each employee must be assigned a single function/role within the system.
- AC14-2: The attributes Name, Phone Number, and E-mail Address are mandatory.
- AC14-3: The Phone Number and Citizen Card Number must comply with the Portuguese format.
- AC14-4: The Phone Number and E-mail Address must be unique across all registered employees.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

n/a

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

_Identity here the data to be inputted by the system actor as well as the output data that the system has/needs to present in order to properly support the actor actions. Regarding the inputted data, it is suggested to distinguish between typed data and selected data (e.g. from a list)._

- Input Data:
  - Name
  - Phone Number
  - Email
  - Address
- Selected Data:
  - Function/Role

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

_Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirements. All interactions must be numbered._

## 2. Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

_In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the Domain Model (DM) that is seen as relevant to fulfill the requirements._

### 2.2. Other Remarks

_Use this section to capture some additional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration in the design activity. In some cases, it might be useful to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams)._


## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| ...  	         | 	...			                                     | ...    | ...                           | ...              
| ...  	         | 	...			                                     | ...    | ...                           | ...

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- Class1
- Class2
- Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- xxxxView
- xxxxController

### 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view representing the sequence of interactions between software objects that allows to fulfill the requirements._

![USXX-SD](svg/USXX-SD.svg)

### 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirements as well as their relations, attributes and methods._

## 4. Tests

_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with empty values.

    class ExampleFixture : public ::testing::Test {
        TEST_F(ExampleFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
            EXPECT_THROW(new Example(L"",L"Example One"),std::invalid_argument);
        }
    }

_It is also recommended organizing this content by subsections._


## 5. Construction (Implementation)

_In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommended to mention/describe the existence of other relevant files (e.g. configuration) and highlight relevant commits._

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


## 6. Integration and Demo

_In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system._


## 7. Observations

_In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work._
